        <h1>Personal User Manual</h1>
        <p>What is this? See <a href="https://www.flexos.work/learn/the-best-personal-user-manual-for-work-guide-template">this article</a> for an explainer.</p>
        <h2>Values</h2>
        <p>
            I value
            <ul>
                <li>honesty</li>
                <li>integrity</li>
                <li>intrinsic motivation</li>
                <li>bias for action</li>
                <li>extreme ownership</li>
                <li>logical reasoning</li>
                <li>grit</li>
                <li>attention to detail</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Decisions</h2>
        <p>Data is good, but good decisions do not always require it.</p>
        <p>Time is the most precious asset, so I default to saying no to new commitments.</p>
        <p>One-way door decisions are made slowly and methodically. Two-way door decisions are made quickly and iteratively. See <a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">this shareholder letter</a> for an explanation of difference.</p>
        <p>When I make a decision, I communicate it clearly and concisely.</p>
        <p>I must be presented with evidence more compelling than that I currently have to change course.</p>
        <h2>Work and Focus</h2>
        <p>I work best asynchronously and when given long, uninterrupted stretches to think deeply.</p>
        <p>When collaborating, I prefer a video call with screen sharing to minimize miscommunication.</p>
        <p>I am most productive when I can focus on a single task for an extended period of time.</p>
        <p>I sometimes work in intense bursts of activity at odd hours.</p>
        <p>I thrive in environments that value strategic thinking and embrace calculated risk-taking to drive meaningful change.</p>
        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>I strongly prefer a write-first culture where meetings are to agree upon a pre-existing document that all stakeholders have reviewed and contributed to.</p>
        <p>When having a meeting, I prefer at least 48 hours of notice and a written document articulating the reason for the meeting, what questions we need answered, and what action items we want to decide on before the end of the call.</p>
